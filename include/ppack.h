 * @defgroup ppack_api Ppack Library
 *
 * @brief Generic payload serialisation/deserialisation for bit-aligned fields.
 *
 * @details
 *    The ppack library serialises and deserialises C structures into a
 *    variable-size payload (any multiple of 8 bits, up to 512 bits)
 *    using arbitrary bit-aligned field descriptors. It supports
 *    @c uint8_t, @c uint16_t, @c int16_t, @c uint32_t, @c int32_t,
 *    IEEE-754 @c float, and raw bitfields up to 32 bits wide. The
 *    512-bit ceiling matches the maximum CAN-FD frame data field.
 *
 *    The payload size is supplied at the call site via the
 *    @c payload_bits argument; classic 8-byte CAN payloads use
 *    @c payload_bits=64, CAN-FD frames may use up to 512.
 *
 *    The @c base_ptr parameter for pack/unpack operations should point
 *    to the structure that the @c ptr_offset members refer to. The
 *    unpack operation overwrites the structure's members with the
 *    decoded values.
 *
 *    Requires C11 (uses @c _Static_assert in @c ppack_platform.h).
 *
 *    ## Wire format
 *
 *    The payload is treated as N bits numbered 0..N-1, where N is the
 *    @c payload_bits argument.
 *    Bit @c K is in logical byte @c (K / 8) at position @c (K mod 8).
 *    Logical byte 0 is the first byte on the wire.
 *
 *    Bit 0 is the least significant bit within each logical byte.
 *    Multi-byte fields use little-endian order. This matches DBC
 *    @c byte_order=1. A 16-bit field at @c start_bit=0 with value
 *    @c 0x1234 writes @c 0x34 to byte 0 and @c 0x12 to byte 1.
 *
 *    @c PPACK_TYPE_F32 copies 32 IEEE-754 bits directly.
 *    The wire bytes follow the host @c uint32_t byte order.
 *    Any two little-endian hosts interoperate (for example,
 *    x86_64, ARM Cortex-M, AArch64, 16-bit MAU platforms).
 *    Little-endian and big-endian hosts do not interoperate without
 *    explicit byte swapping in user code.
 *
 *    Declare the payload buffer as @c ppack_byte_t payload[PPACK_PAYLOAD_UNITS].
 *    This model works on all MAU sizes.
 *    The @c PPACK_PAYLOAD_UNITS macro declares a 64-bit payload by default
 *    (8 bytes or four 16-bit words).
 *    Override @c PPACK_PAYLOAD_BITS at the toolchain level for other sizes
 *    (for example, @c -DPPACK_PAYLOAD_BITS=512).
 *    The runtime API takes the size as an explicit argument.
 *
 *    ## Scaled-field semantics
 *
 *    When @c behaviour is @c PPACK_BEHAVIOUR_SCALED the library applies:
 *    @code
 *      pack:    raw      = (physical - offset) / scale  -> integer
 *      unpack:  physical = (float)raw * scale + offset
 *    @endcode
 *
 *    @b Saturation: ppack_pack clamps the raw integer to the
 *    destination type's range (for example, 0..65535 for
 *    @c PPACK_TYPE_UINT16). Validate the input at the call site
 *    if your application must detect out-of-range physical values.
 *
 *    @b Quantization: ppack_pack truncates the float-to-integer cast
 *    toward zero (standard C cast rules). The maximum round-trip error
 *    is one LSB, equal to @c scale.
 *    Add @c 0.5f*scale*sign(physical) at the call site for
 *    round-to-nearest behaviour.
 *
 *    @b Float-range clamp: for @c PPACK_TYPE_UINT32 scaled fields,
 *    ppack_pack clamps to @c 4294967040. This is the largest float
 *    value that fits in a @c uint32_t.
 *    For @c PPACK_TYPE_INT32 it clamps to @c 2147483520.
 *    The values @c UINT32_MAX and @c INT32_MAX round up to
 *    @c 2^32 or @c 2^31 as 32-bit floats. That overflows the cast.
 *
 *    @b Non-finite values: ppack_pack rejects a SCALED field when
 *    the result is NaN. The function returns @c -PPACK_ERR_INVALARG.
 *    NaN can come from the source value or the scale/offset calculation.
 *    NaN has no valid integer representation.
 *    Positive and negative infinity saturate to the type's clamp bounds.
 *    @c PPACK_TYPE_F32 fields copy bits directly.
 *    They carry NaN and infinity values unchanged.
 *
 *    ## 16-bit MAU Platform Notes
 *
 *    On 16-bit MAU platforms, @c CHAR_BIT is 16.
 *    Any @c uint8_t the toolchain provides uses 16-bit storage.
 *    ppack detects this from @c CHAR_BIT and @c UCHAR_MAX.
 *    The library selects a 16-bit storage unit internally.
 *    It keeps an 8-bit logical layout to match other primitives.
 *    Two contract points apply on this platform:
 *
 *    @li A @c PPACK_TYPE_UINT8 field carries only the low 8 bits of its
 *        struct member through the wire. On pack, the upper 8 bits of
 *        the member's 16-bit storage are read but masked out. On
 *        unpack, the member's FULL storage unit is written: the low 8
 *        bits receive the wire value and the upper 8 bits are zeroed.
 *        Do not keep sentinel data in the upper bits of a
 *        @c PPACK_TYPE_UINT8 member; it will not survive an unpack.
 *
 *    @li The @c ptr_offset value comes from @c offsetof(), which
 *        returns @c char-units. On 16-bit MAU platforms a @c char is 16
 *        bits, so the value is naturally in 16-bit units; the library
 *        does not need to translate it. Always use @c offsetof() rather
 *        than computing offsets by hand.
