 *
 * @brief
 *    Platform abstraction for ppack.
 *
 *    The library detects the target minimum addressable unit (MAU)
 *    size (8 or 16 bits). It defines the type aliases and
 *    compile-time constants the implementation needs.
 *
 *    On byte-addressable targets (x86_64, ARM, AArch64, RISC-V, AVR)
 *    @c ppack_byte_t is @c uint8_t.
 *
 *    On targets where @c CHAR_BIT is 16, @c ppack_byte_t is @c uint16_t.
 *    ppack uses 8-bit logical units for the payload on all targets.
 *    This matches other primitives in this project, such as @c ucrc.
 *
 *    @c PPACK_PAYLOAD_BITS sets the default payload size for the
 *    @c PPACK_PAYLOAD_UNITS buffer-sizing macro.
 *    The @c ppack.h header defines @c PPACK_PAYLOAD_UNITS.
 *    Override @c PPACK_PAYLOAD_BITS before you include this header
 *    (for example, @c -DPPACK_PAYLOAD_BITS=128 or
 *    @c -DPPACK_PAYLOAD_BITS=512).
 *    The runtime API takes the payload size as an explicit argument.
 *
 *    The library's wire format is identical across both addressing
 *    models: a sequence of N bits (where N is the @c payload_bits
 *    argument, a multiple of 8 between 8 and 512), with bit 0
 *    corresponding to the least significant bit of the first logical
 *    8-bit byte. See the "Wire format" section in the README for the
 *    full contract.
 *
 *    Define @c PPACK_SIMULATE_16BIT_MAU at compile time on a byte-
 *    addressable host to exercise the 16-bit MAU code path.
 *    Use this flag for library development and host unit tests only.
 *    Production builds must leave it undefined.
